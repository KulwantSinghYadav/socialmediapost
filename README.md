By providing a topic and a description of your product or service, the application generates relevant social media posts to keep your followers engaged.

## How It Works

2. **Enter your product or service description**: Provide a brief description of the product or service you offer.
3. **Click "Generate Ad Copy"**: The application will then start processing your inputs.

### Process and Results
1. **News Analysis**: The application takes the topic and product description and finds the latest relevant news related to the provided information.
2. **Social Media Post Generation**: It analyzes the top news articles and creates a social media post based on the news, your product, and the given topic. The application provides you with three top news articles and generates three social media post options for each of those articles.
3. **Image Suggestions**: For each social media post, the application searches the internet for images that could be relevant to the post, providing you with the three most relevant image links for each post.
